Our research team studies the practice factors supporting skill acquisition and skill maintenance. We also conduct metascience projects examining kinesiology and sport science research. Our research team is committed to open science and transparent research practices. The lab is located in the [Department of Kinesiology](https://www.science.mcmaster.ca/kinesiology/) within the [Faculty of Science](https://www.science.mcmaster.ca/) at [McMaster University](https://www.mcmaster.ca/).

Our research is supported by the [Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/), the [Canadian Foundation for Innovation](https://www.innovation.ca/), and the [Ontario Research Fund](https://www.ontario.ca/page/ontario-research-fund-research-infrastructure).

This site is permanently a work in progress. Last updated May 2022.

<!--
This file is left intentionally empty by default to be backwards compatible with the initial theme setup.

Although the theme has advanced a little bit and it now allows to specify the content on the main page (even if the list of posts/articles is not intended).
This can be:
- with the list of posts/articles (default: `mainSections = ["post"]) or
- without the list of posts/articles (by setting `mainSections = [""]`)

Markdown supported, ie:

```
# Welcome

- Hugo theme :rocket:

Don't forget to check the README.md file!
```

Remember that you can also specify a section header for the posts below by configuring the `mainSectionsTitle` parameter in the front matter of this file.
