## Human-robot and human-human interactions

Motor interactions between multiple agents is common in everyday life. In recent years, the prevalence of assistive robots has increased in a variety of rehabilitative and training settings (e.g., surgery) where the human and robot collaborate to achieve a common goal. During such collaborative interactions, the human user must plan and execute their actions in relations to what they anticipate the robotic device will do. We are interested in determining how humans interact with robots when they each have some independent control over the same control point.


## The influence of feedback characteristics on motor learning

Feedback plays a vital role in our ability to acquire motor skills. It has even been suggested to be the most important factor for skill acquisition after practice itself. Feedback that is provided to an individual during a training session can be provided verbally or using technology (e.g., video replay). The characteristics of the feedback provided during the learning process can be classified as finely-graded (e.g., -20 cm from a target), graded (e.g., too short or too long), or binary (e.g., hit or miss). Unlike finely-graded and graded feedback, binary feedback does not generate an error-signal and as such, relies on reinforcement learning processes rather than error-based learning processes. We are interested in how these different feedback characteristics impact motor learning across the lifespan and the subjective valuation of this feedback.

## Kinesiology metascience

In recent years, there has been a lot of discussion about the replication crisis in psychology, neuroscience, and medical research to name just a few. Much of this is likely attributed to questionable research practices such as, but not limited to, p-hacking, HARKing (or Hypothesizing After Results are Known), publication bias, and a flawed incentive structure within academia. Metascience is the field of research on the scientific process itself and has been effective in advancing our understanding of how science (should) work and why it sometimes fails. We are interested in applying metaresearch techniques to better understand the state of motor behaviour research in particular, but also more generally the field of kinesiology.

## Decision-making for multiple skill learning

When we wish to learn something new we often have to take charge of our own training protocol. Learning a new musical instrument like the guitar involves learning multiple component tasks such as unique hand postures for different notes and chords. When learning alone, we must decide how to invest in learning all task variations. Although some work has examined this question, these studies have held the amount of training constant across each task. However, in our daily lives we do not always allocate an equal amount of time to each task we are trying to learn. Instead, we must make purposeful decisions about how to invest our time (e.g., whether to exploit known skills or explore less-known ones) to maximize overall proficiency. We are interested in the factors that affect our training choices and whether these decisions are optimal when the amount of training per skill can vary.

## Aging, disease, and motor control and learning

Although motor performance tends to decline as we age, our capacity to learn new skills remains intact. The significance of our ability to perform skilled actions and activities of daily living across the lifespan is exemplified by the many cases of individuals living with a neurological disease (e.g., Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s) or stroke. These individuals experience long-term movement-related and cognitive deficits that can greatly reduce their functional independence and quality of life. We are interested in identifying the practice factors the supporting motor learning in healthy aging populations, as well as those that can help maintain functional independence in individuals living with mild cognitive impairment and/or Alzheimer’s disease.
